Fields: Sales over region, broken down by chain.

**Sales and Gross Margin by Financial Year Quarters:**
Created charts for sales, gross profit, and financial year quarters.
Changed the gross profit to a line visual.
Formatted labels to one decimal place.

**Breakdown of Sales by Chain with a Pie Chart:**
Utilized a pie chart for chain-wise sales breakdown.

**Map View Showing State Performances:**
Used a globe map visualization with state and sales against the state.
Concatenated state and country for specificity.
Created a new column using the power pivot module for a more specific state representation.
Removed the state field and replaced it with the newly created column (state, country).
Note: Higher density of colors indicates higher value.

**Sales and Category by Chain Using a Bar Chart:**
Utilized a bar chart for sales and categories by chain due to long category names.
Sorted by the largest categories and then by sales.

**Visual of Sales and Gross Profit by Category Across Time Using a Bubble Chart:**
Created a bubble chart with a play axis for financial quarters.
Calculated gross profit percentage and formatted it into one decimal place.
The gross profit represents the size of the bubble.
X-axis had the gross profit percentage.

**Slicer for State Filtering:**
I created a slicer to enable the dashboard to be filtered by state.
